      The Christmas assembly for Warm Winter Wishes (WWW) was a success.There was video’s Skits and the price that WWW collected from Fundraisers and donations. The Events they had were Exotic animal experience, Community dinner’s, Raffle, Toy drive and Midget hockey game for the Community to take part in. For school they had Chili cook off, Bake sales, Butler auction Cotton candy, Mini stick tournament, Snow cones, Taco fiesta, Santa photo’s, Movie, Hockey, Slushies, Soup, Silent auction, PJ Rama, and the assembly. Teacher Barb Cowen Said. “Without their support, we wouldn’t have been able to raise more than $300,000 since we started.” All the events they put on, they were great in my opinion. It’s also good knowing that you are helping people that are in need. The assembly they had a Kahoot game about some of the teachers and things they like. They also had a skit where the “teacher” didn’t pronounce any of the names right. The last thing they did was announced how much they raised. They raised $35,683.65. They also had the WHSS band play some songs. They were play Christmas music like “Here Comes Santa”, “Santa's Coming To Town” and many more. “It was a okay assembly it could have been better if santa was there but you can’t get everything you want.” Said Hunter
